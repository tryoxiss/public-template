# Contribution Guide

Heyo! We are glad you are interested in contributing to bonfire! This document should help get you up to speed, and if you have any questions about the code or otherwise, feel free to message either **@tryoxiss** or **@khaim0919** for help!

## How to contribute

All contributions are bound by our [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), but as long as your a reasonable person you should be good. 

Whatever you are working on, please create an issue (if there isn't already one) for it for tracking pourposes. When you are working on an issue, please kindly ask to be assigned to it so we can keep track of who is doing what, which makes collaboration easier when multiple people want to work on the same thing!

Also: please feel free to create issues even if you do not intend to work on them yourself, this helps us know what we need to get done, and helps people who want to work on the project but don't know what to do find something to work on!

## What we need

Don't know how how to code? No worries! We have many things we need each with thier own skillsets! All modules are watched by **@tryoxiss** and all code is also watched by **@khaim0919**, but some modules may have thier own managers. As follows are a list of jobs you could do (both coding, and non coding)
